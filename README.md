## Error Handling

### Common Error Codes

- `400` - Bad Request (Invalid input data)
- `401` - Unauthorized (Invalid credentials or missing token)
- `403` - Forbidden (Insufficient permissions)
- `404` - Not Found (Resource not found)
- `409` - Conflict (Duplicate data)
- `422` - Unprocessable Entity (Validation errors)
- `500` - Internal Server Error

### Validation Errors

When request validation fails, the API returns detailed error information:

```json
{
  "status": "fail",
  "message": "Validation failed",
  "details": [
    {
      "field": "email",
      "message": "Invalid email format"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Rate Limiting

The API implements rate limiting to prevent abuse:

- **General endpoints**: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- **Authentication endpoints**: 5 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- **Upload endpoints**: 10 requests per hour per user

## Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/reflectify
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
SERVICE_API_KEY=your-service-api-key
NODE_ENV=development|production
PORT=4000
```

### CORS Configuration

- **Development**: All origins allowed
- **Production**: Only `https://reflectify.live` allowed

## Data Models

### Key Enums

```typescript
enum Designation {
  SUPER_ADMIN
  HOD
  AsstProf
  LabAsst
}

enum SubjectType {
  MANDATORY
  ELECTIVE
}

enum LectureType {
  LECTURE
  LAB
  TUTORIAL
  SEMINAR
  PROJECT
}

enum FormStatus {
  DRAFT
  ACTIVE
  CLOSED
}

enum SemesterTypeEnum {
  ODD
  EVEN
}
```

## Testing

### Test Client Example

```javascript
const fetch = require('node-fetch');

const baseUrl = 'http://localhost:4000/api/v1';
const token = 'your-jwt-token';

// Example: Get all departments
const response = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/departments`, {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
});

const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);
```

## Security Features

1. **Helmet.js** - Security headers
2. **CORS** - Cross-origin resource sharing
3. **JWT** - Token-based authentication
4. **Role-based authorization** - Fine-grained access control
5. **Input validation** - Zod schema validation
6. **SQL injection protection** - Prisma ORM
7. **Rate limiting** - Request throttling

## Deployment

### Production Considerations

1. Set `NODE_ENV=production`
2. Use strong JWT secrets
3. Configure proper CORS origins
4. Set up SSL/TLS certificates
5. Use environment variables for sensitive data
6. Enable request logging
7. Set up monitoring and alerting
